### ⭐ Comparative Analysis & Key Learnings

The projects provided a strong comparative view of modeling techniques:

| Comparison | Observation | Conclusion |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HMM vs. LSTM** | LSTMs (e.g., **96% accuracy** on POS) consistently outperformed HMMs (e.g., **95%**) because they capture **long-range contextual dependencies**, while HMMs are limited to the Markov assumption (local context). | **Deep Learning models** are superior for tasks requiring sophisticated context modeling. |
| **LSTM vs. Transformer** | **Transformers** excel in tasks requiring complex alignment and non-sequential dependencies (like Transliteration) due to the **Self-Attention mechanism**, which processes all tokens in parallel. | **Attention-based architectures** provide a powerful, generalized framework for complex sequence-to-sequence problems. |
| **Traditional DL vs. LLMs** | **LLMs** (like GPT-5-mini in POS Tagging) demonstrate superior zero/few-shot performance and overall generalization (e.g., **94% accuracy**). However, they sometimes fail on highly specific, rule-based character mappings (Transliteration). | **LLMs are state-of-the-art** for semantic and general NLP tasks, but dedicated **Seq2Seq models are essential** for explicit, character-level transformations. |
